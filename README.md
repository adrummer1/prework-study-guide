# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide is a webpage that demonstrates the basic coding languages necessary for website development. Those languages include:
- HTML: For establishing content on a website
- CSS: For styling the content on a website
- Git: For collaborating with teammates on a website project in the GitHub environment
- JavaScript: For making a website interactive for users

I built this webpage for two reasons. To serve as my own hands-on practice for understanding the basics on the above coding languages, and to serve as a reference tool for future development project.

During the project I learned the basics of these coding languages in preparation for the full stack coding boot camp.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
